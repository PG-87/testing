Unit testing training.

RomanNumeral
    -Write unit test for the method convert
    -Try @ParameterizedTest for all the different characters
    -Can you identify any tests that the current code in convert can't handle?

    -Create tests and code for a method that converts a decimal number into a RomanNumeral
    public String convert(int number){}

triangle/Triangle
    -Create unit tests for the class Triangle with 100% code coverage.
    -Fix any errors in the Triangle code.
    -Refactor and Clean the code. Look at suggestions from IntelliJ, method and variable naming
     and maybe we can use some stream function for solving our uniqueSides() method?
     Try writing sides.st eller sides.d and look at the suggestions.
